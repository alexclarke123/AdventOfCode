task: match all horizontal positions of all crabs; in the most efficient manner possible

each change in 1 step of 1 crab costs 1 fuel

need to determine which horizontal position that is


we have a list of numbers
we want to update each number in the list to the same number, by addition or deduction
the sum of all the respective additions and deductions will give us our total number
we want to find the lowest total number possible

ideas: 
    simple but possibly the "long way round" is to loop through different potential positions
    on each loop record the lower of the previous loop or the current loop, in terms of the total of
    absolute substractions and additions

idea2:
    can we do a goal seek type loop where we triangulate to the right number?
    e.g. try 1 then try 1000

idea3: 
    does using the Median number help here?
